    		<h1> Digging</h1>

            <h3>  By Seamus Heaney </h3>

            <p>Between my finger and my thumb<br>
            The squat pen rests; snug as a gun.</p>

            <p>Under my window, a clean rasping sound <br>
            When the spade sinks into gravelly ground: <br>
            My father, digging. I look down</p>

            <p>Till his straining rump among the flowerbeds  <br>
            Bends low, comes up twenty years away  <br>
            Stooping in rhythm through potato drills   <br>
            Where he was digging.</p>

            <p>The coarse boot nestled on the lug, the shaft   <br>
            Against the inside knee was levered firmly.<br>
            He rooted out tall tops, buried the bright edge deep   <br>
            To scatter new potatoes that we picked,<br>
            Loving their cool hardness in our hands.</p>

            <p>By God, the old man could handle a spade.   <br>
            Just like his old man.</p>

            <p>My grandfather cut more turf in a day   <br>
            Than any other man on Toner's bog.   <br>
            Once I carried him milk in a bottle<br>
            Corked sloppily with paper. He straightened up <br>
            To drink it, then fell to right away   <br>
            Nicking and slicing neatly, heaving sods   <br>
            Over his shoulder, going down and down <br>
            For the good turf. Digging.</p>

            <p>The cold smell of potato mould, the squelch and slap</p>

            <p>Of soggy peat, the curt cuts of an edge <br>
            Through living roots awaken in my head.<br>
            But I've no spade to follow men like them.</p>

            <p>Between my finger and my thumb  <br>
            The squat pen rests.   <br>
            I'll dig with it.</p>
