<h1>Digging</h1> 
<h5>By Seamus Heaney</h3>

<br>

<p>Between my finger and my thumb<br>  
		<br> 
The squat pen rests; snug as a gun.</p>

<br>

<p>Under my window, a clean rasping sound <br>  
		<br>
When the spade sinks into gravelly ground: <br>  
		<br>
My father, digging. I look down</p>

<br>

<p>Till his straining rump among the flowerbeds  <br> 
		<br>
Bends low, comes up twenty years away   <br>
		<br>
Stooping in rhythm through potato drills  <br> 
		<br>
Where he was digging.</p>

<br>

<p>The coarse boot nestled on the lug, the shaft  <br> 
		<br>
Against the inside knee was levered firmly.<br>
		<br>
He rooted out tall tops, buried the bright edge deep<br>
		<br>
To scatter new potatoes that we picked,<br>
		<br>
Loving their cool hardness in our hands.</p>

<br>

<p>By God, the old man could handle a spade.   <br>
		<br>
Just like his old man.</p>

<br>

<p>My grandfather cut more turf in a day<br>
		<br>
Than any other man on Tonerâ€™s bog.<br>
		<br>
Once I carried him milk in a bottle<br>
		<br>
Corked sloppily with paper. He straightened up<br>
		<br>
To drink it, then fell to right away<br>
		<br>
Nicking and slicing neatly, heaving sods<br>
		<br>
Over his shoulder, going down and down<br>
		<br>
For the good turf. Digging.</p>

<br>

<p>The cold smell of potato mould, the squelch and slap<br>
		<br>
Of soggy peat, the curt cuts of an edge<br>
		<br>
Through living roots awaken in my head.<br>
		<br>
But I've no spade to follow men like them.</p>

<br>

<p>Between my finger and my thumb<br>
		<br>		
The squat pen rests.<br>
		<br>
I'll dig with it.</p>
