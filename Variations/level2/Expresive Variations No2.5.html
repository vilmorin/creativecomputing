	<h1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Digging</h1>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between my finger and my thumb<br>   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The squat pen rests; snug as a gun.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under my window, a clean rasping sound <br>  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the spade sinks into gravelly ground: <br>  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My father, digging. I look down</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till his straining rump among the flowerbeds  <br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bends low, comes up twenty years away   <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stooping in rhythm through potato drills  <br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where he was digging.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coarse boot nestled on the lug, the shaft  <br> 
	
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against the inside knee was levered firmly.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He rooted out tall tops, buried the bright edge deep<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To scatter new potatoes that we picked,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loving their cool hardness in our hands.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By God, the old man could handle a spade.   <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just like his old man.</p>


<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My grandfather cut more turf in a day<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than any other man on Tonerâ€™s bog.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once I carried him milk in a bottle<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corked sloppily with paper. He straightened up<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To drink it, then fell to right away<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicking and slicing neatly, heaving sods<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over his shoulder, going down and down<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the good turf. Digging.</p>


<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cold smell of potato mould, the squelch and slap<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of soggy peat, the curt cuts of an edge<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through living roots awaken in my head.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I've no spade to follow men like them.</p>


<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between my finger and my thumb<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The squat pen rests.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll dig with it.</p>
