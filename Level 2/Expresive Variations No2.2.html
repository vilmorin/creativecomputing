<h1>Digging</h1> 
<h2>By Seamus Heaney</h2>

		<br>
<ul>
<p><li><strong>Between my finger and my thumb</strong><br>  
		<br> 
The squat pen rests; <em>snug as a gun</em>.</p></li>

		<br>

<p><li>Under my window, a <em>clean rasping </em>sound <br>  
		<br>
When the spade sinks into gravelly ground: <br>  
		<br>
My father, digging. I look down</p></li>

		<br>

<p><li>Till his straining rump among the flowerbeds  <br> 
		<br>
Bends low, comes up twenty years away  <br>
		<br>
Stooping in rhythm through potato drills  <br> 
		<br>
Where he was digging.</p></li>

		<br>

<p><li>The coarse boot nestled on the lug, the shaft  <br> 
		<br>
Against the inside knee was levered <strong>firmly.</strong><br>
		<br>
He rooted out tall tops, buried the bright edge deep<br>
		<br>
To scatter new potatoes that we picked,<br>
		<br>
Loving their cool hardness in our hands.</p></li>

		<br>

<p><li>By God, the old man could handle a <strong>spade.</strong>   <br>
		<br>
Just like his old man.</p></li>

		<br>

<p><li>My grandfather cut more turf in a day<br>
		<br>
Than any other man on Tonerâ€™s bog.<br>
		<br>
Once I carried him milk in a bottle<br>
		<br>
Corked sloppily with paper. He straightened up<br>
		<br>
To drink it, then fell to right away<br>
		<br>
Nicking and slicing neatly, heaving sods<br>
		<br>
Over his shoulder, going down and down<br>
		<br>
For the good turf. <strong>Digging.</strong></p></li>

		<br>

<p><li>The <em>cold smell of potato mould</em>, the squelch and slap<br>
		<br>
Of soggy peat, the curt cuts of an edge<br>
		<br>
Through living roots awaken in my head.<br>
		<br>
But I've no spade to follow men like them.</p></li>

		<br>

<p><li><strong>Between my finger and my thumb</strong><br>
		<br>		
The squat pen rests.<br>
		<br>
I'll dig with it.</p></li>
</ul>
