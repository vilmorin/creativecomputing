                <p> My daily trip to school consists of a 10-15 minute bike ride. CitiBike is my main form of transportation, and there is a station across the street from my apartment in alphabet city. I take out a bike and I make my way to school, usually pedaling fast to be on time. As I make my way from my apartment in the coast of manhattan, to school, I encounter things that are different every ride. I often see things like film shoots, a dozen different dog breeds, and people riding hover boards and other high tech transportation. Though every ride is different, I usually bike on the same streets and I always aim to get to school as fast as I can, without getting run over by a taxi. </p>

                <p>Unfortunately there are no subway stations near where I live, so even when the weather is bad, I have to bike. On rainy days, I have to wear a raincoat and brace myself for a wet ride with low visibility. The worst thing I can encounter when I am in a rush, is an CitiBike station with no bikes available. This means I will have to walk to the nearest available station, which usually is not near at all. </p>

                <p>My route to school always cuts through Tompkins Square Park, which is a nice break from the cars and busy streets. Even though most parks donâ€™t allow riding inside the park, Tompkins is always full of bikers. During this period I get to enjoy the trees and open space that make the ride much more pleasant. </p>

                <p>By the time I get to Parsons I am in the center of the city (5th Av) which is a lot busier and chaotic. Most of the time I arrive to school I am rushing to get to class. I find the nearest CitiBike station, drop off my bike and run into school. </p>
